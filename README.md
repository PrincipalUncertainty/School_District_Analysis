# School_District_Analysis
Summary: A technical analysis with five requested deliverables to inform district administrators and select specialists to both specific and high-level outcomes in school performance including: specific students and grade level, school type, school name, reading and math scores, and the school's budget.

## Key Adjustments in the Analysis
The data here encompasses a great range of information as identified above.  In order to ensure accuracy in search and analysis the data was cleaneed of any duplicate or incomplete sets of information such that there are no repetitive or null oitcomes throughout the data set.

## Notable Observations and Calculations Available
* Mean math and reading scores by grade, school name, and/or school type
* Minimum and maximum math and reading scores by grade, school name, and/or school type
* Total math and reading scores by school
* Summary statistics per grade level
* Identification of outliers among reading and math scores
* Average math score by grade for each school type
* Average budget for each school type: Charter = $872,626.00, Public = $911,195.00

## Future Considerations
The data set, now cleaned and sorted, may provide ample information to inform both academic and financial information and outcomes as a function of student features like grade levels and academic scores.  This may be used to direct budgetary changes, academic adjustments to target math or reading scores, and suss out differences between public and charter school performance as a function of their budgets and student performance.

Lastly, this data-set and its strengths may be enhanced by providing information on younger grades, additinoal school types, scores in disciplines of science and art, and outcomes by students after graduation.
